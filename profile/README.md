# Astrocartics

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the website https://eve.astrocartics.xyz/ and it's subsequent documentation. It is our goal to maintain a map proving succinct information about the greater Eve Universe, colloquially known as a New Eden, for the greater [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) gaming community. 

The vast majority of our project is open source. This makes documentation easily accessible for us from all locations through any modality. It also helps us to improve our knowledge base and expand our project in ways we might not have thought of before. 
Feel free to have a look around and make a pull request to add to the many features on our website. We not only welcome you, but challenge you to make a lasting impact in this open source project.
